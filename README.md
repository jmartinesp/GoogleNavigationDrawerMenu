# GoogleNavigationDrawerMenu

This project aims to let you use a ListView menu similar to the one in the new Google Apps (Keep, Play Music...) without having to do any extra effort. Sorry for the long name, though.

## Features

With GoogleNavigationDrawerMenu you can:

  * Set a GoogleApp-styled DrawerLayout menu and only have to specify the main content for your app, you no longer have set the ListView and its styles. Everything is handled by the **GoogleNavigationDrawer** class.
  * Set main and secondary sections to the menu.
  * Set a list of icons for those sections (optional).
  * Both text and icons remain selected when you click on them.
  * Set an *OnNavigationSectionSelected* listener so you can handle section selection events.
  * Change the background of the list items.
  * Set a header and footer to the inner ListView.

## How to use

###1. Include the library:

  **Manually (Option A):**

  Download the source code and import ```GoogleNavigationDrawerMenuLibrary``` folder as a Library Module in Android Studio or as a Project in Eclipse (still not tested).

  **Manually (Option B):**

  * Download the [AAR](aars/GoogleNavigationDrawerMenu.aar?raw=true).
  * Put it in the ```aars``` folder of your Android Studio project.
  * Add a File Dependency or add it to the ```build.gradle``` of your main Module, like this:

        repositories {
          mavenCentral()
          flatDir {
              dirs 'aars'
          }
        }

  Notice the ```flatDir``` local maven repository created. Now you will have to add the aar file to the *dependencies* list, as if you were adding it from Maven Central Repository:

        compile 'com.arasthel:gnavdrawer-library:1.0.+'


**Automatic (Gradle):**

Add it to your Application Module's `build.gradle`:

Declare it into your build.gradle

    dependencies{
        compile 'com.arasthel:gnavdrawer-library:1.0.+'
    }

###2. Use class in XML or code:

####Example of how to use it on an XML code:

```xml
<org.arasthel.googlenavdrawermenu.views.GoogleNavigationDrawer
xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
android:id="@+id/navigation_drawer_container"
android:layout_width="match_parent"
android:layout_height="match_parent"
app:list_paddingTop="?android:actionBarSize"
app:drawer_gravity="start"
app:list_mainSectionsEntries="@array/navigation_main_sections"
app:list_secondarySectionsEntries="@array/navigation_secondary_sections"
app:list_mainSectionsDrawables="@array/drawable_ids"
app:list_secondarySectionsDrawables="@array/drawable_ids">

  <FrameLayout
      android:id="@+id/content_layout"
      android:layout_width="match_parent"
      android:layout_height="match_parent"/>

</org.arasthel.googlenavdrawermenu.views.GoogleNavigationDrawer>
```

You may think *'Ok, so where's the menu?'*. Well, the GoogleNavigationDrawer class itself contains it and handles it so you don't have to manually modify it. You can customize it, though, you can find that info in [**Customizing Section**](#4-customizing-the-inner-listview).

All the `app:*` attributes are optional, but if you don't provide any entries you will have to do it later in code with `drawer.setListViewSections(...)`.

####Using GoogleNavigationDrawer in Java Code:

```java
ViewGroup container = (ViewGroup) findViewById(R.id.container);
GoogleNavigationDrawer drawer = new GoogleNavigationDrawer(context);
// Here we are providing data to the adapter of the ListView
drawer.setListViewSections(new String[]{"Section A", "Section B"}, // Main sections
        new String[]{"Settings"}, // Secondary sections
        new int[]{R.drawable.ic_launcher}, // Main sections icon ids
        null); // Secondary sections icon ids
// To work correctly, a DrawerLayout must be the only View in a ViewGroup
container.removeAllViews();
container.addView(drawer);
// Now we add the content to the drawer since the menu is already there.
// Also, DrawerLayout forces the contentView to be the first item. Otherwise, you can't click on the menu.
drawer.addView(contentView, 0);
```


GoogleNavigationDrawer extends DrawerLayout. This means you can use DrawerLayout methods and set a DrawerListener to it.

###3. Handling selection, opening and closing of the menu:

 As you cannot access the inner ListView to ensure encapsulation, additional methods have been provided so you can do it by code. This methods are:

```java
public boolean isDrawerMenuOpen();

public void openDrawerMenu();

public void closeDrawerMenu();
```

Also, to handle section selections, a listener has been provided:

```java
public void setOnNavigationSectionSelected(OnNavigationSectionSelected listener);
```


###4. Customizing the inner ListView:

 Finally, customization. The main XML attributes of the class are the following:

```xml
app:list_padding[Top, Bottom, Left, Right]="dimen"
app:drawer_gravity="start"
app:list_mainSectionsEntries="array"
app:list_secondarySectionsEntries="array"
app:list_mainSectionsDrawables="array"
app:list_secondarySectionsDrawables="array"
app:list_headerView="layout"
app:list_footerView="layout"
app:list_headerClickable="boolean"
app:list_footerClickable="boolean"
app:list_mainSectionsBackground="drawable"
app:list_secondarySectionsBackground="drawable"
```


Example of *arrays* in ```arrays.xml```:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>

    <string-array name="navigation_main_sections">
        <item>Home</item>
        <item>Some Other</item>
    </string-array>

    <string-array name="navigation_secondary_sections">
        <item>Settings</item>
        <item>Info</item>
    </string-array>

    <array name="drawable_ids">
        <item>@drawable/ic_home</item>
        <item>@drawable/ic_other</item>
    </array>

</resources>
```

Also, both icon drawables and backgrounds **should have checked states** to keep them consistent with the rest of the library:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

<selector xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <item android:state_checked="true" android:drawable="@drawable/ic_on"></item>
    <item android:drawable="@drawable/ic_off"></item>
</selector>
```

All these attributes can also be set by code.

This means you can use the library in whatever way you want and also I take no responsibility of what it could do (thermo-nuclear explosions and such).

Anyway, it would be really nice of you if you could give this library a line in some "About" section in your app.
